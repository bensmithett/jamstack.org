description: Fast static HTML with opt-in JS islands. Built with React and Vite.

Tropical is a modern, flexible static site generator without the complex, hidden framework magic. 

It's just [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) plus a layer of **familiar, industry-standard tools & conventions** (like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Ladle](https://ladle.dev/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) & [Fela](https://fela.js.org/)) for building *fast*, HTML-first websites. When it comes to browser JS performance, Tropical has had [islands](https://tropical.js.org/docs/browser-js) since before they [were cool](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/).

And Tropical is **just a [template repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)**. There's nothing to `init`, no library to install or configure, and no painful API churn or framework inflexibility. If [Vite can do it](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html), so can your Tropical site.
